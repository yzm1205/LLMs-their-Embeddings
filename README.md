# LLMs
The repository comprises various language models, encompassing both smaller models such as Sentence-BERT, Universal Sentence Encoder(USE).. as well as larger models like LlaMa2,GPT-Ada.... This repository serves as a demonstration of how to generate sentence or document embeddings using these language models. One key advantage of this repository is its facilitation of straightforward model output comparison, enabling users to easily decide which model best aligns with their specific task.

## LLM models:
LLM model and their demonstration showed
